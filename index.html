          <h2>Software Engineer and Journalist</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm a software engineer at The Washington Post working on innovative and resilient tools for the newsroom. I've had most digital jobs in news, from web producer (KCET, Pew Research Center), to data and graphics reporter (The Marshall Project, Wall Street Journal) to news developer (San Francisco Chronicle).</p>
          <p>My super power is being able to communicate across teams, from technical experts to beat reporters.</p>

        <h2>Other work I'm proud of:</h2>
        <h3>Lecturer</h3>
        <p>For the last two years, I've co-taught an intro to coding class at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. Over a 16-week course, students learn about accessibility, design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's one of the most fulfilling jobs I've had, being able to see a new crop of coder-journalists who are thoughtful, push boundaries and demand accountability. Some of my thoughts upon joining were shared in an <a href="https://journalism.berkeley.edu/alumni-portrait-yoli-martinez/">Alumni Portrait</a>.</p>
        <h3>Conference Presenter and Organizer</h3>
        <p>I've led conversations and hands-on trainings at NICAR, <a href="https://2021.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-fri-talk">SRCCON</a>, NAHJ and EIJ. I'm particularly proud of a 9 a.m. Excel session featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/frankwords/status/1169998356132880387/retweets/with_comments">pivot tables</a>. In 2020, I was a Curriculum Co-Chair working for the first virtual NAHJ/NABJ joint conference. The following year I took on the role of NAHJ Conference Chair, recruiting over a dozen industry leaders to create a training curriculum for the month-long virtual conference. The work was featured in an article for <a href="http://latinoreporter.org/2021/gente-de-nahj-with-weeks-of-pre-conference-training-chair-yoli-martinez-ran-the-longest-convention-ever/">Latino Reporter</a>, the conference student newsroom.</p>
        <h3>Mentorship</h3>
        <p>I am always happy to talk to students, early career folks and those making career pivots into journalism. Are you a person of color and have questions about journalism school, career growth, salary transparency, or newsroom culture? </p>
